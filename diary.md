# Day 9 (Th, 2025-10-09)

Very little time today, I just managed to work through the section on look-ahead patterns.

# Day 8 (We, 2025-10-08)

I worked through the first half of the chapter on regular expressions; that's all for today.

# Day 7 (Tu, 2025-10-07)

I read chapter 7 on Bugs and Errors, for which I took very few notes. I'd like to re-implement _Spot_ in JavaScript now.

# Day 6 (Mo, 2025-10-06)

I summarized chapter 6 on OOP, for which I took quite some notes.

# Day 5 (Su, 2025-10-05)

I just skimmed chapter 5, of which I took some notes on unicode code points. I probably should have picked _Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja_ (Second Edition) for this exercise. But this at least will leave me more time for actual programming. I really should implement both _Reversi_ and _Spot_ in JavaScript.

I just looked up Deno again, and it just seems to be the perfect fit for me: It has a small test library and native TypeScript support. So instead of dealing with Node.js and NPM, I can just stick to Deno. It also supports ECMAScript modules, which is always a hassle to deal with when working with TypeScript and Node.js. So Deno it will be, until I look into Angular.

# Day 4 (Sa, 2025-10-04)

I worked through chapter 4 and took quite some notes.

# Day 3 (Fr, 2025-10-03)

I quickly read chapter 3, for which I didn't take any notes at all.

# Day 2 (Th, 2025-10-02)

Very little time today, so I just went quickly through chapter 2, for which I only took very few notes.

# Day 1 (We, 2025-10-01)

I wrote down my plan in the [README](README.md) and worked through the introduction and the first chapter of _Eloquent JavaScript_. Thereby, I took some notes on the `typeof` and `??` operators as well as on `undefined` and `null` and their subtleties.
