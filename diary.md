# Day 5 (Su, 2025-10-05)

I just skimmed chapter 5, of which I took some notes on unicode code points. I probably should have picked _Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja_ (Second Edition) for this exercise. But this at least will leave me more time for actual programming. I really should implement both _Reversi_ and _Spot_ in JavaScript.

# Day 4 (Sa, 2025-10-04)

I worked through chapter 4 and took quite some notes.

# Day 3 (Fr, 2025-10-03)

I quickly read chapter 3, for which I didn't take any notes at all.

# Day 2 (Th, 2025-10-02)

Very little time today, so I just went quickly through chapter 2, for which I only took very few notes.

# Day 1 (We, 2025-10-01)

I wrote down my plan in the [README](README.md) and worked through the introduction and the first chapter of _Eloquent JavaScript_. Thereby, I took some notes on the `typeof` and `??` operators as well as on `undefined` and `null` and their subtleties.
